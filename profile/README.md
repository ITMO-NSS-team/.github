*Hi, this is NSS Lab*

**We are conduct a lot of AI/ML researches in different fields**

Our laboratory is part of the Research Center for Strong Artificial Intelligence (ITMO University, Russia), 
which provides cutting-edge software and algorithmic solutions. 
We focus on natural systems simulations, generative design, data-driven modeling, automated machine learning, equation discovery, etc.

Also, we support the extension of scientific open source community (see [ITMO.OpenSource](https://ods.ai/hubs/opensource_itmo)). The information about on-going papers are available in [open tracker](https://github.com/orgs/ITMO-NSS-team/projects/5).
